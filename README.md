# Kaggle-American-Sign-Language-Fingerspelling-Recognition

# Context

The goal of that competition was to detect and translate American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling into text. The data included more than three million fingerspelled characters produced by over 100 Deaf signers, captured via the selfie camera of a smartphone with a variety of backgrounds and lighting conditions.

# About our ranking 

Our team consisted of 3 members, Yanis Bardes, Jeremy Lin and myself. We gave it our all in this competition and managed to place 52nd out of 1339 on the day the competition closed, representing the top 4% and a silver medal, which is very respectable for a first public competition on Kaggle. However, after closing, our medals were not available and 2 days after closing, we discovered that our team had been banned from the competition, like 24 others apparently (cause on the actual leaderbord, 1 315 teams remained), without any warning. In fact, one of my colleagues used a second account to submit to the competition, as he was desperate to test a model configuration on the last day, when we had no submissions left. This last submission lifted his second account to 51st place, which virtually put us 2 places off the leaderboard. After talking to Kaggle, they were able to confirm that this was the reason for our ban... We've obviously apologized to Kaggle, and for our next competitions, we'll try to respect all the platform's rules. Here are a few screenshots justifying our ranking, which is no longer visible on the public leaderboard.
